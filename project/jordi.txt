Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Your shields were failing, sir. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. What? We're not at all alike! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. We have a saboteur aboard. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone This should be interesting. Computer, belay that order. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. You enjoyed that. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. They were just sucked into space. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?

KILL WESLEY CRUSHER!
